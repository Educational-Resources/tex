# TeX code for educational resources
LaTeX classes and packages for educational materials

## Idea
I am a math teacher in Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg, Germany. This repository contains LaTeX
code I use to typeset educational material for my lessons. It's not primarily
intendet to be used by a general public. I nevertheless invite you to make
use of whatever may be beneficial for your own teaching.

If you have ideas or suggestions for further development or expansion, please
get in touch!

## Usage
To use the LaTeX resources you need a recent TeX distribution (e.g. TeXLive).
You can generate a class or package along with it's documentation by running
LaTeX on the associated .dtx file or calling make.
The generated files should be stored somewhere LaTeX can find it.
